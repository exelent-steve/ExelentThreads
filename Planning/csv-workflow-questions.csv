ID,Topic,Description,Status,Priority,Category,Date_Created,Date_Updated,Claude_Comments,User Comments
INST,[INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE],Steve: Please review each topic and add your thoughts in the Your_Comments column. Update Status if you have a decision. Claude will then respond in Claude_Comments column. And to keep going to the next columns for further interactions.,,,,,,,
1,Current CSV Structure,What columns does your current CSV have when working with Claude Code? Share an example or describe the structure.,Resolved,HIGH,Technical,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"PERFECT! We'll use this CSV as the template. Final structure: ID (UUID), Topic, Description, Status, Priority, Category, Date_Created, Date_Updated, Your_Comments, Claude_Comments (+ more comment columns as needed). Instructions will tell AI to update Date_Updated.",There isn't a proper one.We make them up each time. This is the first time we are thinking formally. This makes sense but we need to tell AI to uipdate the Date Updated column each time.
2,Multi-Comment Columns Strategy,"You said: Claude 1, User 1, Claude 2, User 2 etc. Should we: (A) Add new columns each round (Claude_1, User_1, Claude_2...) or (B) Keep 2 columns and append with timestamps?",Resolved,HIGH,Data Model,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"RECOMMENDATION: Add new columns each round (Your_Comments, Claude_Comments, Your_Comments_2, Claude_Comments_2, etc). SIMPLER for AI to update (just add to new column vs parsing existing). Date_Updated tracks when row changed. In DB, we'll store each comment with timestamp. CSV = simple for Claude Code, DB = rich data for app.","I thought it's  just easier to add columns each time. But u know tech better.But if we update the same cell each time, it's harder to read so maybe it's also harder for AI to update properly. Which makes me think should we have a date and time for each comment?We probably need it for the database. So that would be even more columns. Think and come back to me. Remember I'm not a developer so I don't know tech well know to know implocations"
3,File Watching vs Manual,"Should app: (A) Watch file automatically and notify when CSV changes, (B) User clicks 'Check for Updates' button, (C) Both options available?",Resolved,HIGH,UX/Workflow,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"PERFECT! Checking every 30 secs is negligible resources. We'll add: (1) Auto-check with configurable interval (default 30s), (2) Manual ""Refresh"" button, (3) Settings to disable auto-check or change interval. Toast notification when changes detected.",Does it really use a lot of resources to check say every 30 secs?But also need a manual option to update. Also user can set how often to check or not at all. That way I can turn it off when I don't need it
4,Column Order Handling,"If Claude messes up column order should we: (A) Auto-detect columns by name (flexible), (B) Enforce strict order and show error, (C) Auto-fix and re-export?",Resolved,MEDIUM,Technical,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"AGREED! Parse by column name, not position. Much more robust. We'll also validate on import - if column name missing or wrong, show clear error message with what we expected vs what we found.",Agree if we don't make a mistake
5,Technology Choice - Desktop or Web,"Build as: (A) Electron desktop app (works offline, file system access, quick build), (B) Next.js web app (upload/download CSV, hosted), (C) VS Code extension for Claude Code?",Resolved,HIGH,Technical,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"DECISION: Next.js with local server (like your other app). You're familiar with it, we can use SQLite/Turso for DB, and it's just as fast to build as Electron. Extension = sidebar in Claude Code IDE but more limited. Next.js = full control, can add AI later.",I don't ynderstand the VS Code extension to integrate with Code.How does that work? I know nothing about that. I want the database so can we have that withElectron. Also u create code so quickly so does it matter really if it's Electorn or Next.js. My other app uses Next amd I run a local server
6,Instructions Row Location,"Where to put AI instructions: (A) First row of CSV with [INSTRUCTIONS] marker, (B) Separate .txt file (issues_instructions.txt), (C) Built into app (user doesn't see it)?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"AGREED! First row with [INSTRUCTIONS] marker. Keeps everything in one file. Easy to see and edit. App will parse this row specially and include in export.",A for now. We could change later.But it's easier to give a CSV to Code with no additional text. 
7,When Do You Need This,"Timeline: (A) This week (need bare minimum), (B) Next week (can wait for polish), (C) Two weeks (want it more complete)?",Resolved,HIGH,Planning,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"GOT IT! Build it all - full featured CSV workflow. Import, all views (Conversation/Table/Board/Timeline), search, file watching, export. You're confident I can code fast and you want to demo it working. Let's do it!",U r doing all the coding and u r quick.So u can do it all if u think u can make it work
8,Display Views Needed,"Which views for MVP: (A) Just list view, (B) List + detail modal, (C) List + detail + board view, (D) All views from current mock?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"GREAT! All views from current demo. It's true - same data, different UI presentation. Conversation view (like your comment on row 21-22), Table, Board, Timeline. Easy to reuse components.",it's on UI playing with ythe same content so can u do them all?
9,Status Values,"What status values to support: (A) Open/In Progress/Resolved/Closed, (B) Open/Done, (C) Custom per project, (D) Match your current CSV?",Resolved,MEDIUM,Data Model,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"CONFIRMED! Open / In Progress / Resolved / Closed. Standard workflow statuses. Color coded in UI.",Option A
10,Priority vs No Priority,Do you need priority field (High/Medium/Low) or is status enough for now?,Resolved,LOW,Data Model,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"CONFIRMED! Add Priority field with High/Medium/Low values. Helps with sorting and filtering.",Add Priority
11,Category/Tags System,"Do you use categories/tags in your CSVs? If yes, what categories?",Resolved,LOW,Data Model,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"SMART! Instructions row will include example categories (Technical, UX, Database, etc). AI can suggest new categories. App maintains category list in DB and shows in UI dropdown. User can also create custom categories.","Didn'\t u sauy once the app via code can work out categories.For now, we should offer examples maybe to AI in a row but allow it to make its own but udpate the category list in the csv file. "
12,Date Tracking,"Track dates for: (A) Created + Updated, (B) Just Updated, (C) No dates?",Resolved,LOW,Data Model,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"CONFIRMED! Date_Created (when topic first added) and Date_Updated (last modification). Both stored in CSV and DB. Shown in UI.",Yes. I made a comment about it above
13,Import Behavior - Duplicates,"When importing updated CSV with existing IDs: (A) Update existing topics, (B) Keep both versions, (C) Ask user what to do?",Resolved,MEDIUM,Technical,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"PERFECT! UUIDs for IDs. Same UUID = update existing topic. New row from AI = app generates UUID and saves to CSV. User adds row = app adds UUID before saving. Simple sync logic!","Let's use UUIDs if that's OK. And the idea is if we get a CSVwith the same IDs then we know to update. When AI sends a new row, we add a UUID. If the user adds a new row/topic, we add the UUID to the csv before saving"
14,Export Behavior - Preserve Changes,"When exporting CSV after you've made changes in app: (A) Overwrite original CSV, (B) Create new file (issues_v2.csv), (C) Ask user?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"GOOD APPROACH! Export flow: (1) Create backup (filename_backup_timestamp.csv), (2) Overwrite original file. User just tells Claude Code ""look at updated csv"" and it reads same filename. Safe and simple!","Create backup of old but update same file so Claude knows to pick it up.In Claude I can just say ""look at updated csv file"" as the only prompt, unless u can automate it which u mentioned above"
15,Instruction Template Customization,"Should instructions be: (A) Fixed template in app, (B) User can edit before export, (C) Saved templates (template 1: review, template 2: implement)?",Resolved,LOW,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"GREAT IDEA! App will have 3-5 templates (Review, Implement, Prioritize, Decide). User can select, edit before export, and save custom templates. Instructions go in INST row (row 1). Simple and flexible!","I hadn't thought of it. We can have a few templates which we should assume is correct but allow them to change. And that goes in the first row of content, right?"
16,Editing Topics in App,"Can user edit topics in the app? (A) Yes - edit any field, (B) Yes - only comments, (C) Read-only - edit in CSV only?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"CLEAR RULES! User can edit: (1) Status/Priority/Category always, (2) Your_Comments always, (3) Topic/Description ONLY when first created (lock after first export to Claude). Date fields auto-updated. Claude_Comments read-only. Makes sense!","User can edit all rows apart from date/time and Claude comments. But can only edit Topic and Desctiption first time they are received from AI, or created by the user. "
17,Adding New Topics,Can user add new topics in app or only import from CSV?,Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"YES! ""New Topic"" button creates topic in app, generates UUID, saves to DB and immediately exports to CSV. You use this often so it's essential.",Add as I do that often
18,Search/Filter,Need search or filter functionality in the list view?,Resolved,LOW,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"LOVE IT! Add search bar (searches Title/Description/Comments) and filter dropdowns (Status, Priority, Category). Same as current demo. Easy to implement.",Why not add it? U can code it
19,Multi-File Support,"Work with: (A) One CSV at a time, (B) Multiple CSVs (different projects), (C) Folder of CSVs?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"PERFECT! Multi-project support. Left sidebar shows project list. Each project = one CSV file. Click to switch. Projects stored in DB with file path to CSV. You can work on multiple simultaneously!",Allow multiple projects (I have multiple CSVs open now) but one CSV per project
20,Example CSV,Can you create an example CSV file showing your current structure so I can match it exactly?,Resolved,HIGH,Technical,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"DONE! This CSV IS the example! We're using it to design itself (eating our own cake). Perfect template for the parser.",Call it this one and as we are commenting on it
21,Chat interface,What to put in chat interface,Resolved,HIGH,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"YOU'RE RIGHT! I confused the two versions. mockup-v2.html was for the FULL version (chat-first with AI). CSV workflow is SIMPLER: Import CSV → Display topics → Edit in app → Export CSV → Send to Claude Code. NO integrated chat. The ""conversation"" is the import/export cycle with Claude Code.",You have too much content in there. It really should be about giving it  the CSV and receiving.We also don't have a real chat going on with AI in this version. So it's just telling the app to save the content. Or am I wrong?
22,Topics,How Topic interfaces should look,Resolved,HIGH,UX,03/11/2025,03/11/2025,"EXACTLY! Copy the first mockup UI (index.html demo). Same views: Conversation/Table/Board/Timeline/Analytics. Same topic cards. Same modals. Just different data source (CSV file + DB instead of hardcoded data.js). CSV workflow = current demo + import/export + file watching.","As close as we can to our first mockup. It should work similar, tell me if not, as the only difference is tehres manual work for the CSVbut it's the same idea"
