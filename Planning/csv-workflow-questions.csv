INST,"[INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE]","Steve: Please review each topic and add your thoughts in the Your_Comments column. Update Status if you have a decision. Claude will then respond in Claude_Comments column.",,,,,,
1,Current CSV Structure,What columns does your current CSV have when working with Claude Code? Share an example or describe the structure.,Open,HIGH,Technical,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"I need to see your actual CSV format to match it. Are you using: Issue/Description/Status? Or something else? This determines our import parser."
2,Multi-Comment Columns Strategy,"You said: Claude 1, User 1, Claude 2, User 2 etc. Should we: (A) Add new columns each round (Claude_1, User_1, Claude_2...) or (B) Keep 2 columns and append with timestamps?",Open,HIGH,Data Model,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Option A = unlimited columns, harder to display. Option B = 2 columns (Your_Comments, Claude_Comments) with dated entries like '2025-11-03: Try Postgres | 2025-11-04: Yes, good choice'. Which do you prefer? Or Option C: Separate conversation log per topic?"
3,File Watching vs Manual,"Should app: (A) Watch file automatically and notify when CSV changes, (B) User clicks 'Check for Updates' button, (C) Both options available?",Open,HIGH,UX/Workflow,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"File watching = convenient but uses system resources. Manual = user controls timing. Hybrid = watch is default but can disable. What fits your workflow?"
4,Column Order Handling,"If Claude messes up column order should we: (A) Auto-detect columns by name (flexible), (B) Enforce strict order and show error, (C) Auto-fix and re-export?",Open,MEDIUM,Technical,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Recommendation: Option A (detect by name). More robust. We parse headers, don't care about order. Example: ID can be column 1 or 5, we find it by 'ID' header. Agree?"
5,Technology Choice - Desktop or Web,"Build as: (A) Electron desktop app (works offline, file system access, quick build), (B) Next.js web app (upload/download CSV, hosted), (C) VS Code extension for Claude Code?",Open,HIGH,Technical,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Electron = 1-2 days, use immediately, offline. Web = 3-4 days, need hosting, upload/download. Extension = 2-3 days, integrated into Claude Code. Which fits your workflow best?"
6,Instructions Row Location,"Where to put AI instructions: (A) First row of CSV with [INSTRUCTIONS] marker, (B) Separate .txt file (issues_instructions.txt), (C) Built into app (user doesn't see it)?",Open,MEDIUM,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Option A = visible to you and Claude. Option B = cleaner CSV but extra file. Option C = app generates on export, invisible. I lean toward A for transparency - you can edit instructions yourself."
7,When Do You Need This,"Timeline: (A) This week (need bare minimum), (B) Next week (can wait for polish), (C) Two weeks (want it more complete)?",Open,HIGH,Planning,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Determines scope. This week = import/display/export only. Next week = add file watching. Two weeks = add chat UI. What's your urgency?"
8,Display Views Needed,"Which views for MVP: (A) Just list view, (B) List + detail modal, (C) List + detail + board view, (D) All views from current mock?",Open,MEDIUM,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Simpler = faster. List view might be enough initially. Detail modal helps for long descriptions. Board view is nice-to-have. What's minimum you need?"
9,Status Values,"What status values to support: (A) Open/In Progress/Resolved/Closed, (B) Open/Done, (C) Custom per project, (D) Match your current CSV?",Open,MEDIUM,Data Model,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Need to know what statuses you're already using. We'll match that. Can always add more later. What's in your CSVs now?"
10,Priority vs No Priority,"Do you need priority field (High/Medium/Low) or is status enough for now?",Open,LOW,Data Model,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Priority helps sorting but adds complexity. Your call. What matters more: speed to build or feature completeness?"
11,Category/Tags System,"Do you use categories/tags in your CSVs? If yes, what categories?",Open,LOW,Data Model,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Helps filtering. Example: Technical, Content, Design, Bug. Or skip for MVP? What do you need?"
12,Date Tracking,"Track dates for: (A) Created + Updated, (B) Just Updated, (C) No dates?",Open,LOW,Data Model,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Helpful for seeing when topics were added/changed. Low priority but easy to add. Want it?"
13,Import Behavior - Duplicates,"When importing updated CSV with existing IDs: (A) Update existing topics, (B) Keep both versions, (C) Ask user what to do?",Open,MEDIUM,Technical,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"If ID=1 exists in app and you import CSV with ID=1, should we update it or create duplicate? Probably update, but confirm."
14,Export Behavior - Preserve Changes,"When exporting CSV after you've made changes in app: (A) Overwrite original CSV, (B) Create new file (issues_v2.csv), (C) Ask user?",Open,MEDIUM,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Don't want to lose your work. Maybe always create new file with timestamp? Or backup old file first? What feels safe?"
15,Instruction Template Customization,"Should instructions be: (A) Fixed template in app, (B) User can edit before export, (C) Saved templates (template 1: review, template 2: implement)?",Open,LOW,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"You might want different instructions for different situations. 'Review these' vs 'Implement these' vs 'Prioritize these'. Templates would help. Need it now or later?"
16,Editing Topics in App,"Can user edit topics in the app? (A) Yes - edit any field, (B) Yes - only comments, (C) Read-only - edit in CSV only?",Open,MEDIUM,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"If you can edit in app, need to handle sync with CSV. If read-only, simpler but less useful. What's your workflow? Edit in app or in spreadsheet?"
17,Adding New Topics,"Can user add new topics in app or only import from CSV?",Open,MEDIUM,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Adding in app = more useful but adds complexity. Import-only = simpler. Phase 1 vs Phase 2 decision?"
18,Search/Filter,"Need search or filter functionality in the list view?",Open,LOW,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"Nice to have but not essential for MVP. Can defer to Phase 2? Or do you have lots of topics and need it?"
19,Multi-File Support,"Work with: (A) One CSV at a time, (B) Multiple CSVs (different projects), (C) Folder of CSVs?",Open,MEDIUM,UX,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"You mentioned multiple projects. Should app handle multiple CSV files or focus on one for now? What's your use case?"
20,Example CSV,"Can you create an example CSV file showing your current structure so I can match it exactly?",Open,HIGH,Technical,2025-11-03,2025-11-03,,"This is critical! Please share a sample CSV (can be dummy data) so I build the parser correctly. Or describe the exact columns you use."
