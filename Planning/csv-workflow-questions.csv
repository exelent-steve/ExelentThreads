ID,Topic,Description,Status,Priority,Category,Date_Created,Date_Updated,Claude_Comments,User Comments,Claude_Comments_2,User 2
INST,[INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE],"CRITICAL RULES FOR AI: (1) NEVER overwrite existing comment columns - ALWAYS add a NEW column to the right. (2) Name new columns sequentially: Your_Comments, Claude_Comments, Your_Comments_2, Claude_Comments_2, etc. (3) Prefix each comment with timestamp: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: ' (4) Update Date_Updated column (Column H) to current date when modifying any row. (5) Update Status column (Column D) to Resolved when answering. (6) Fixed columns A-H are: ID, Topic, Description, Status, Priority, Category, Date_Created, Date_Updated. (7) Parser identifies columns by NAME not position - column order can vary. (8) ID column uses UUIDs (format: topic_abc123). (9) This CSV file is the TEMPLATE - use exact structure when creating exports.",,,,,,,,,
1,Current CSV Structure,What columns does your current CSV have when working with Claude Code? Share an example or describe the structure.,Resolved,HIGH,Technical,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,I need to see your actual CSV format to match it. Are you using: Issue/Description/Status? Or something else? This determines our import parser.,There isn't a proper one.We make them up each time. This is the first time we are thinking formally. This makes sense but we need to tell AI to uipdate the Date Updated column each time.,"2025-11-05 14:35: PERFECT! We'll use this CSV as the template. Final structure confirmed: ID (UUID), Topic, Description, Status, Priority, Category, Date_Created, Date_Updated, Your_Comments, Claude_Comments (+ expandable comment columns). Instructions will tell AI to update Date_Updated each time it modifies a row.",
2,Multi-Comment Columns Strategy,"You said: Claude 1, User 1, Claude 2, User 2 etc. Should we: (A) Add new columns each round (Claude_1, User_1, Claude_2...) or (B) Keep 2 columns and append with timestamps?",Resolved,HIGH,Data Model,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"Option A = unlimited columns, harder to display. Option B = 2 columns (Your_Comments, Claude_Comments) with dated entries like '2025-11-03: Try Postgres | 2025-11-04: Yes, good choice'. Which do you prefer? Or Option C: Separate conversation log per topic?","I thought it's  just easier to add columns each time. But u know tech better.But if we update the same cell each time, it's harder to read so maybe it's also harder for AI to update properly. Which makes me think should we have a date and time for each comment?We probably need it for the database. So that would be even more columns. Think and come back to me. Remember I'm not a developer so I don't know tech well know to know implocations","2025-11-05 14:36: RECOMMENDATION - Add new columns each round (Your_Comments, Claude_Comments, Your_Comments_2, Claude_Comments_2, etc). SIMPLER for AI - just add to new column vs parsing existing text. For date/time: prefix each comment with ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: "" syntax (like this one). In CSV = simple text. In DB = each comment stored as separate row with full timestamp. Best of both worlds!",
3,File Watching vs Manual,"Should app: (A) Watch file automatically and notify when CSV changes, (B) User clicks 'Check for Updates' button, (C) Both options available?",Resolved,HIGH,UX/Workflow,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,File watching = convenient but uses system resources. Manual = user controls timing. Hybrid = watch is default but can disable. What fits your workflow?,Does it really use a lot of resources to check say every 30 secs?But also need a manual option to update. Also user can set how often to check or not at all. That way I can turn it off when I don't need it,"2025-11-05 14:37: PERFECT! Checking every 30 secs uses negligible resources (just reads file modification timestamp). Implementation: (1) Auto-check with configurable interval (default 30s), (2) Manual ""Refresh"" button, (3) Settings to disable auto-check or change interval (10s/30s/60s/off). Toast notification when changes detected: ""CSV updated - click to import"".",
4,Column Order Handling,"If Claude messes up column order should we: (A) Auto-detect columns by name (flexible), (B) Enforce strict order and show error, (C) Auto-fix and re-export?",Resolved,MEDIUM,Technical,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"Recommendation: Option A (detect by name). More robust. We parse headers, don't care about order. Example: ID can be column 1 or 5, we find it by 'ID' header. Agree?",Agree if we don't make a mistake,"2025-11-05 14:38: AGREED! Parser logic: Read header row → create columnName-to-index map → parse data rows by name. Validation: if required column missing (ID, Topic, Description, Status) → show clear error: ""Missing required column: [name]. Found: [list of actual columns]"". Flexible and robust.",
5,Technology Choice - Desktop or Web,"Build as: (A) Electron desktop app (works offline, file system access, quick build), (B) Next.js web app (upload/download CSV, hosted), (C) VS Code extension for Claude Code?",Resolved,HIGH,Technical,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"Electron = 1-2 days, use immediately, offline. Web = 3-4 days, need hosting, upload/download. Extension = 2-3 days, integrated into Claude Code. Which fits your workflow best?",I don't ynderstand the VS Code extension to integrate with Code.How does that work? I know nothing about that. I want the database so can we have that withElectron. Also u create code so quickly so does it matter really if it's Electorn or Next.js. My other app uses Next amd I run a local server,"2025-11-05 14:39: DECISION - Next.js with local dev server (like your other app). Why: (1) You're familiar with Next.js, (2) SQLite/Turso works perfectly for database, (3) Just as fast to build as Electron, (4) Can easily add hosted version later if you want. VS Code extension = sidebar panel in Claude Code IDE, but more limited. Next.js = full control, better for Phase 2 AI features.",
6,Instructions Row Location,"Where to put AI instructions: (A) First row of CSV with [INSTRUCTIONS] marker, (B) Separate .txt file (issues_instructions.txt), (C) Built into app (user doesn't see it)?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"Option A = visible to you and Claude. Option B = cleaner CSV but extra file. Option C = app generates on export, invisible. I lean toward A for transparency - you can edit instructions yourself.",A for now. We could change later.But it's easier to give a CSV to Code with no additional text.,"2025-11-05 14:40: AGREED! Row 1 with ID=""INST"" and [INSTRUCTIONS] marker in Topic field. Parser skips this row for data, includes in export. You can see and edit instructions anytime. Single file = simpler workflow with Claude Code.",
7,When Do You Need This,"Timeline: (A) This week (need bare minimum), (B) Next week (can wait for polish), (C) Two weeks (want it more complete)?",Resolved,HIGH,Planning,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Determines scope. This week = import/display/export only. Next week = add file watching. Two weeks = add chat UI. What's your urgency?,U r doing all the coding and u r quick.So u can do it all if u think u can make it work,"2025-11-05 14:41: FULL SPEED AHEAD! Build complete CSV workflow: Import, all views (Conversation/Table/Board/Timeline/Analytics), search/filter, file watching, export, multi-project. You're confident I can deliver fast and you want working demo. Let's do it!",
8,Display Views Needed,"Which views for MVP: (A) Just list view, (B) List + detail modal, (C) List + detail + board view, (D) All views from current mock?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Simpler = faster. List view might be enough initially. Detail modal helps for long descriptions. Board view is nice-to-have. What's minimum you need?,it's on UI playing with ythe same content so can u do them all?,"2025-11-05 14:42: YES! All views from current demo (index.html). True - same data, different UI. Conversation view, Table, Board, Timeline, Analytics. Easy to reuse components - just swap data source from data.js to database.",
9,Status Values,"What status values to support: (A) Open/In Progress/Resolved/Closed, (B) Open/Done, (C) Custom per project, (D) Match your current CSV?",Resolved,MEDIUM,Data Model,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Need to know what statuses you're already using. We'll match that. Can always add more later. What's in your CSVs now?,Option A,"2025-11-05 14:43: CONFIRMED! Status values: Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed. Color coding: Open=blue, In Progress=yellow, Resolved=green, Closed=gray. Stored as enum in DB for validation.",
10,Priority vs No Priority,Do you need priority field (High/Medium/Low) or is status enough for now?,Resolved,LOW,Data Model,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Priority helps sorting but adds complexity. Your call. What matters more: speed to build or feature completeness?,Add Priority,"2025-11-05 14:44: CONFIRMED! Priority field with values: High, Medium, Low. Used for sorting and filtering. Color indicators: High=red, Medium=orange, Low=gray.",
11,Category/Tags System,"Do you use categories/tags in your CSVs? If yes, what categories?",Resolved,LOW,Data Model,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"Helps filtering. Example: Technical, Content, Design, Bug. Or skip for MVP? What do you need?","Didn'\t u sauy once the app via code can work out categories.For now, we should offer examples maybe to AI in a row but allow it to make its own but udpate the category list in the csv file.","2025-11-05 14:45: SMART! Instructions row will suggest example categories (Technical, UX, Database, Backend, Frontend, Planning). AI can use these or create new ones. App maintains category list in database and shows in dropdown. User can also add custom categories in settings.",
12,Date Tracking,"Track dates for: (A) Created + Updated, (B) Just Updated, (C) No dates?",Resolved,LOW,Data Model,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Helpful for seeing when topics were added/changed. Low priority but easy to add. Want it?,Yes. I made a comment about it above,2025-11-05 14:46: CONFIRMED! Date_Created (when topic first added - ISO format) and Date_Updated (last modification - auto-updated by app). Both in CSV and DB. Displayed in UI with relative time ("2 days ago").,
13,Import Behavior - Duplicates,"When importing updated CSV with existing IDs: (A) Update existing topics, (B) Keep both versions, (C) Ask user what to do?",Resolved,MEDIUM,Technical,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"If ID=1 exists in app and you import CSV with ID=1, should we update it or create duplicate? Probably update, but confirm.","Let's use UUIDs if that's OK. And the idea is if we get a CSVwith the same IDs then we know to update. When AI sends a new row, we add a UUID. If the user adds a new row/topic, we add the UUID to the csv before saving","2025-11-05 14:47: PERFECT! UUID strategy: App generates UUIDs (like ""topic_abc123def456""). Import logic: if UUID exists → update that topic, if UUID empty/missing → new topic, generate UUID, save back to CSV. Export always includes UUIDs. Simple sync!",
14,Export Behavior - Preserve Changes,"When exporting CSV after you've made changes in app: (A) Overwrite original CSV, (B) Create new file (issues_v2.csv), (C) Ask user?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Don't want to lose your work. Maybe always create new file with timestamp? Or backup old file first? What feels safe?,"Create backup of old but update same file so Claude knows to pick it up.In Claude I can just say ""look at updated csv file"" as the only prompt, unless u can automate it which u mentioned above","2025-11-05 14:48: SAFE APPROACH! Export flow: (1) Create backup: ""filename_backup_20251105_1448.csv"", (2) Overwrite original file. Backups saved in .backups/ folder. You tell Claude Code: ""look at updated csv"" - same filename. Settings: keep last N backups (default 10), auto-cleanup older ones.",
15,Instruction Template Customization,"Should instructions be: (A) Fixed template in app, (B) User can edit before export, (C) Saved templates (template 1: review, template 2: implement)?",Resolved,LOW,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,You might want different instructions for different situations. 'Review these' vs 'Implement these' vs 'Prioritize these'. Templates would help. Need it now or later?,"I hadn't thought of it. We can have a few templates which we should assume is correct but allow them to change. And that goes in the first row of content, right?","2025-11-05 14:49: GREAT IDEA! Built-in templates: (1) ""Review & Advise"", (2) ""Prioritize Topics"", (3) ""Implementation Plan"", (4) ""Quick Questions"". User can select, edit before export, save custom templates. Instructions go in INST row. Export dialog shows template dropdown + edit box.",
16,Editing Topics in App,"Can user edit topics in the app? (A) Yes - edit any field, (B) Yes - only comments, (C) Read-only - edit in CSV only?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,"If you can edit in app, need to handle sync with CSV. If read-only, simpler but less useful. What's your workflow? Edit in app or in spreadsheet?","User can edit all rows apart from date/time and Claude comments. But can only edit Topic and Desctiption first time they are received from AI, or created by the user.","2025-11-05 14:50: CLEAR RULES! Editable always: Status, Priority, Category, Your_Comments. Editable until first export: Topic, Description (then locked with 🔒 icon). Read-only: Date fields (auto-updated), Claude_Comments, ID. Lock prevents accidental changes to topics Claude is responding about.",
17,Adding New Topics,Can user add new topics in app or only import from CSV?,Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Adding in app = more useful but adds complexity. Import-only = simpler. Phase 1 vs Phase 2 decision?,Add as I do that often,"2025-11-05 14:51: YES! ""+ New Topic"" button in header. Modal with fields: Topic, Description, Status, Priority, Category. App generates UUID, saves to DB, auto-exports to CSV with toast: ""Topic added and exported"". Essential for your workflow.","I guess we can add the date in the app when someone adds a new topic or comment, we don't need AI to do it. No need to reply"
18,Search/Filter,Need search or filter functionality in the list view?,Resolved,LOW,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,Nice to have but not essential for MVP. Can defer to Phase 2? Or do you have lots of topics and need it?,Why not add it? U can code it,"2025-11-05 14:52: LOVE IT! Global search bar (searches Topic, Description, all comment columns - fuzzy match). Filter dropdowns: Status, Priority, Category. Combined filters (AND logic). Same as current demo. Real-time as you type.",You built in search in the mockup anyway
19,Multi-File Support,"Work with: (A) One CSV at a time, (B) Multiple CSVs (different projects), (C) Folder of CSVs?",Resolved,MEDIUM,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,You mentioned multiple projects. Should app handle multiple CSV files or focus on one for now? What's your use case?,Allow multiple projects (I have multiple CSVs open now) but one CSV per project,"2025-11-05 14:53: PERFECT! Multi-project in left sidebar. Each project = one CSV file. Project list shows name + topic count. Click to switch projects. Projects stored in DB with: id, name, csv_file_path, color, last_opened. You can work on multiple simultaneously - switch anytime!",
20,Example CSV,Can you create an example CSV file showing your current structure so I can match it exactly?,Resolved,HIGH,Technical,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,This is critical! Please share a sample CSV (can be dummy data) so I build the parser correctly. Or describe the exact columns you use.,Call it this one and as we are commenting on it,"2025-11-05 14:54: BRILLIANT! This CSV IS the example - we're eating our own cake! Perfect template for parser. Shows instruction row, UUID IDs, expandable comment columns, date format, all data types. Meta!",
21,Chat interface,What to put in chat interface,Resolved,HIGH,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,,You have too much content in there. It really should be about giving it  the CSV and receiving.We also don't have a real chat going on with AI in this version. So it's just telling the app to save the content. Or am I wrong?,2025-11-05 14:55: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! I confused Phase 1 (CSV workflow) with Phase 2 (full AI chat). CSV workflow = SIMPLER: Import CSV → Display topics → Edit → Export → Send to Claude Code (external). NO integrated AI chat in this version. mockup-v2.html was for Phase 2. This is just a nice UI for managing CSVs.,U can make the CSV sending like the chat so we have that area reserved for AI later
22,Topics,How Topic interfaces should look,Resolved,HIGH,UX,03/11/2025,05/11/2025,,"As close as we can to our first mockup. It should work similar, tell me if not, as the only difference is tehres manual work for the CSVbut it's the same idea","2025-11-05 14:56: EXACTLY! Copy current index.html demo UI completely: same views (Conversation/Table/Board/Timeline/Analytics), same topic cards, same modals, same interactions. ONLY difference: data comes from CSV+DB instead of hardcoded data.js. CSV workflow = beautiful UI + import/export + file watching.",
23,Database Schema,How are we storing all this data in the database?,Resolved,HIGH,Technical,05/11/2025,05/11/2025,,,"2025-11-05 14:57: FULL DATABASE SCHEMA - Projects table (id, name, csv_path, color, created_at). Topics table (id/UUID, project_id, topic, description, status, priority, category, date_created, date_updated). Comments table (id, topic_id, author [user/claude], content, comment_round, created_at). This normalizes the data - CSV has flat structure, DB has relational structure for querying/filtering/analytics. Import parses CSV → stores in DB tables. Export reads DB → generates CSV.",I need u 100% to get this right as I won't be able to.
24,Comment Date/Time Storage,How to handle timestamps for each comment round?,Resolved,MEDIUM,Technical,05/11/2025,05/11/2025,,,"2025-11-05 14:58: TWO-LAYER APPROACH - In CSV: prefix comments with ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: "" for human readability (like these responses). In Database: Comments table has created_at timestamp column (full precision). Parser extracts date from prefix OR uses file mod time if missing. Best of both: CSV readable, DB queryable for ""show comments from last week"".",
