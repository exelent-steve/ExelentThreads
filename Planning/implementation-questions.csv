Topic,Category,Claude's Question/Concern,Claude's Proposed Solution,Steve's Response,Priority,Status,Notes
Layout - Main Interface,UI/UX,Where exactly should the chat be positioned? Full left side or left 60%?,Left side takes 60% of screen. Right side 40% shows: (top) topic list with status colors + (bottom) simple analytics card,,"HIGH - affects everything",Open,
Layout - Chat Visibility,UI/UX,Should chat ALWAYS be visible even when viewing analytics dashboards? Or only on main view?,Chat is always visible on left for ALL views. Right side changes: conversation view = topics list; analytics view = charts; board view = kanban. Chat never goes away.,,"HIGH",Open,
Layout - Mobile,UI/UX,On mobile we can't show chat + topics side by side. Tabs or bottom sheet?,Propose: Bottom nav with 3 tabs: Chat / Topics / Analytics. Swipe between them. When in Chat and AI suggests topics a floating button appears to quick-view them.,,"MEDIUM",Open,
Current Mock - What Stays,UI/UX,Which parts of current mock should I keep vs rebuild?,Keep: topic detail modal design + status badges + category pills + the overall color scheme. Rebuild: remove sidebar navigation + remove top header buttons + make chat the main interface.,,"HIGH",Open,
Current Mock - Topic List,UI/UX,The current conversation view shows topics as cards. Should right-side topic list be: (A) Compact list with title+status or (B) Cards like current view?,,"HIGH",Open,Need Steve's preference
Chat Interface - Style,UI/UX,Should chat look like: (A) ChatGPT style (centered messages grey/blue) or (B) Claude style (full width with subtle background) or (C) Something else?,Recommend Claude style - cleaner for long conversations.

Topic Extraction - UI Pattern,AI Logic,"If AI suggests topics mid-conversation how do we show it without interrupting flow?",Inline suggestion bubble appears above chat input: I noticed we discussed 3 things: [API Design] [Database Choice] [Error Handling] → [Create Topics] [Not Now]. Non-blocking stays there until dismissed.,,"HIGH",Open,
Topic Extraction - Auto vs Manual,AI Logic,Should AI auto-create topics or always ask user first?,Always ask first for MVP. Auto-create comes later as a user preference. Users need to trust the system before it acts autonomously.,,"HIGH",Open,Critical for user trust
Topic Linking - Which Message,AI Logic,"When linking a message to a topic how do we handle one message mentioning multiple topics?",Many-to-many relationship: One message can link to multiple topics.

Artifact Display - Editing,Document Management,How should user edit artifacts? Inline editing or separate editor?,Full screen editor overlay. Left = editable document (markdown or code editor) Right = outline/structure navigator. Save button or auto-save every 2sec.,,"HIGH",Open,
Artifact Sections - JSON Structure,Document Management,Steve mentioned splitting docs into sections in JSON. What's the structure?,Need Steve to share structure from other app. Propose: {type: document sections: [{id: s1 title: heading content: markdown order: 1}] version: 1}. AI only regenerates specific sections not whole doc.,,"HIGH",Open,STEVE: Please share your JSON structure example

Results grouped: Messages (with context) Topics (with status) Artifacts (with preview). Click result to jump to location.,,"MEDIUM",Open,
Topic Categories - Predefined or Free,Data Model,Should categories be: (A) Predefined dropdown (technical design business) or (B) Free text tags or (C) Both?,Both. Predefined categories for consistency + free-form tags for flexibility. Categories are single-select tags are multi-select. AI suggests both when creating topic.,,"LOW",Open,
Topic Priority - Needed?,Data Model,Do we need priority field (high/medium/low) or is status enough?,Keep priority for MVP. Users think in terms of what's urgent. Shows as colored indicator: 🔴 high 🟡 medium ⚪ low. AI infers from language (ASAP urgent critical = high).,,"LOW",Open,
Related Topics - Auto-linking,AI Logic,Should AI auto-detect when topics are related and link them? Or manual only?,AI suggests relationships but user confirms. When creating new topic if AI detects similarity (>60% embedding match) show: Similar topics: [API Authentication] [JWT Implementation] → [Link as Related?].,,"MEDIUM",Open,
Multi-Project - MVP?,Scope,Current mock has project selector. Do we need multi-project in MVP or single project?,Single project for MVP. Removes complexity. Add project switching in Phase 2. Just have one default project per user.,,"MEDIUM - reduces scope",Open,Important for timeline
Export - Format,Features,What export formats needed? Markdown? PDF? JSON?,"Markdown for MVP: Export conversation as .md file with topics as H2 sections. Export single topic as .md. JSON export for backup/migration (raw data). PDF nice-to-have for Phase 2.",,"LOW",Open,
Data Persistence,Technical,Should we save to Turso on every message or batch save?,Save every message immediately. Also save draft messages to localStorage so user doesn't lose text if browser crashes. Turso is fast enough for immediate writes.,,"HIGH - prevents data loss",Open,

Offline Mode,Technical,Should app work offline at all? Or require internet?,Require internet for MVP. Offline mode needs service workers + local model + sync logic = too complex. Show friendly message: 📡 You're offline. Reconnecting…,,"LOW - not MVP",Open,
Loading States,UI/UX,How should we show AI is thinking? Typing indicator? Skeleton?,Typing indicator: Three animated dots below last message (like iMessage). Appears immediately when user hits send. Shows while waiting for API response.,,"MEDIUM",Open,
Empty States,UI/UX,"When user first opens app (no messages no topics) what do they see?",Chat shows: Welcome message + 3 example prompts as clickable buttons: Help me design an API Review this architecture Draft a technical spec. Topics panel shows: No topics yet. They'll appear as you chat.,,"MEDIUM",Open,

Conversation History Limit,Technical,Should we limit how many messages display in chat? Infinite scroll or pagination?,Infinite scroll loading oldest messages as user scrolls up. Initially load last 50 messages. Virtual scrolling if performance issue (unlikely for MVP).,,"LOW",Open,
AI Context Window,Technical,How do we handle when conversation exceeds Gemini's context limit?,Gemini Flash 2.0 has 2M tokens (~1.5M words) so unlikely to hit in MVP. If we do: Summarize older messages keep last 20 full. Store full conversation in DB always just send summarized version to AI.,,"LOW - unlikely in MVP",Open,Context limit is massive
System Prompts,AI Logic,What system prompt should we use for the AI assistant?,Need Steve's input on AI personality. Propose: You are a helpful AI assistant for project discussions.

Topic Title Generation,AI Logic,How should AI generate topic titles? User can edit but what's the default?,Extract 3-6 word title capturing core subject. Format: Noun + descriptive phrase (API error handling strategy) not sentences (How should we handle API errors?). User can always edit.,,"MEDIUM",Open,
Topic Description,AI Logic,Should topics have both title AND description? Or just title?,Both. Title is short (shown in list). Description is 1-2 sentences (shown in modal) providing context. AI generates both but user can edit.,,"LOW",Open,
Shortcuts/Hotkeys,UX,Any keyboard shortcuts needed?,Essential ones: ⌘+K = focus search ⌘+Enter = send message Escape = close modal Tab = navigate ⌘+/ = show shortcuts. Power users love shortcuts.,,"LOW",Open,

Theme - Dark Mode,UI/UX,Current mock is light mode. Do we need dark mode for MVP?,Skip dark mode for MVP. Add in Phase 2. Significantly increases CSS work. Most PM/tech tools used during day anyway.,,"LOW - skip for MVP",Open,
Responsive Breakpoints,Technical,At what screen size should we switch to mobile layout?,Desktop: 1024px+ (chat left topics right). Tablet: 768-1023px (collapsible panels). Mobile: <768px (tabs at bottom). Test on: iPhone SE desktop 1920px.,,"MEDIUM",Open,
Git Strategy,Process,Should we keep current demo or create new repo for real MVP?,Keep same repo. Create /mvp folder for new Next.js app. Keep /current for demo reference. Cleaner than new repo keeps history. Can delete demo later.,,"LOW",Open,
Development Approach,Process,Build features in what order?,Week 1: Chat UI + Gemini integration + Turso schema. Week 2: Topic creation + linking. Week 3: Topic list + detail view + status. Week 4: Artifact display + commenting. Week 5: Analytics + polish.,,"HIGH - need agreement on order",Open,STEVE: Does this order make sense?
Testing Strategy,Process,Manual testing or automated tests for MVP?,Manual testing for MVP. You test + I fix. Add tests in Phase 2. Jest + React Testing Library for Next.js when we scale.,,"LOW",Open,
