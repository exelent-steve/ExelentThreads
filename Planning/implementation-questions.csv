Topic,Category,Priority,Status,Claude's Question/Concern,Claude's Proposed Solution,Steve's Response,Claude 2 (Response to Steve)
Layout - Main Interface,UI/UX,HIGH - affects everything,Decided,"Where exactly should the chat be positioned? Full left side or left 60%?",Left side takes 60% of screen. Right side 40% shows: (top) topic list with status colors + (bottom) simple analytics card,i don't understand your right side. I think we need to also be easily able to hide the chat and open it. It won't always be needed. I domn't know if it needs 60%. That's a lot. What do u think?,"AGREED - Let's make chat collapsible with toggle button (← to hide, → to show). When hidden: topics/analytics take full width. When shown: resizable divider (default 40% chat / 60% content, user can adjust 20-80%). Right side = whatever view is active (topics list, board, analytics). Will show in mockup."
Layout - Chat Visibility,UI/UX,HIGH,Decided,Should chat ALWAYS be visible even when viewing analytics dashboards? Or only on main view?,Chat is always visible on left for ALL views. Right side changes: conversation view = topics list; analytics view = charts; board view = kanban. Chat never goes away.,Right or they can hide or minimize if they want. ,"PERFECT - Chat can be minimized/hidden with button. Stays available across all views but user controls visibility. Simple UX pattern."
Layout - Mobile,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,On mobile we can't show chat + topics side by side. Tabs or bottom sheet?,Propose: Bottom nav with 3 tabs: Chat / Topics / Analytics. Swipe between them. When in Chat and AI suggests topics a floating button appears to quick-view them.,U decide. It's less a priority now. Change the style sheet as needed when we need to,"OK - Will use responsive CSS: Desktop = side-by-side, Mobile = tabs. Not critical for initial MVP, can refine later."
Current Mock - What Stays,UI/UX,HIGH,Decided,Which parts of current mock should I keep vs rebuild?,Keep: topic detail modal design + status badges + category pills + the overall color scheme. Rebuild: remove sidebar navigation + remove top header buttons + make chat the main interface.,I think we need to keep as much as we can for what we've built but modify so it works with the new concept. And we need to think what we do with the side bar navigation so maybe it does go at the top or the chat doesn't go all the way to the bottom and we leave some option to the lower part. As a UX expert would you suggest or do we have like a top options icon where they can select things from which I guess is also okay?,"SOLUTION: Keep sidebar navigation at bottom of left panel (below chat). Shows: 📋 Topics View | 📊 Analytics | 📅 Timeline | ⚙️ Settings. Chat takes most of left side, nav icons at bottom. When chat is hidden, these nav items can move to top bar. Cleaner than hamburger menu. Will show in mockup."
Current Mock - Topic List,UI/UX,HIGH,Decided,The current conversation view shows topics as cards. Should right-side topic list be: (A) Compact list with title+status or (B) Cards like current view?,(Original cell was empty - my mistake),You kind of messed up on this road so I had to fix it. There's no text in the previous cell. I was hoping it would be the same unless you think there's not enough space.,"OOPS - sorry about blank cell! DECISION: Keep the current card design for topics. It's clean and has space for status/category/preview. Just adapt it to right-side width. Cards work better than compact list for scanning."
Chat Interface - Style,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,Should chat look like: (A) ChatGPT style (centered messages grey/blue) or (B) Claude style (full width with subtle background) or (C) Something else?,Recommend Claude style - cleaner for long conversations. User messages light background right-aligned AI messages no background left-aligned.,Whatever you think because I don't have a preference,"DECISION: Claude style. User messages = light blue bg + right-aligned. AI messages = left-aligned + no bg. Avatars: U = user initial, AI = icon. Clean and readable."
Chat Interface - Input,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,Should message input be: (A) Bottom of chat panel with send button or (B) Floating at bottom with attachments button?,Bottom of chat panel fixed position. Send button + small icon for future file attachments. Auto-resize textarea up to 5 lines.,"I would like the idea that you can actually change the relation of the ratio between what AI sends and what you write so you could have more or less either. I'm not sure others offer this, but the size would be really useful. And the send button or somewhere that you need to think about How, allows you to select which topics you want to send with the send or not at all. We need to have prompts that are ready to work with the system prompt AI to ask the user that we have the subject shall we make them into topics. Need to make sure that we get the prompts really good straight away.","GREAT IDEAS: (1) Resizable input area - drag divider to make bigger/smaller (2-8 lines). (2) Topic selector: small dropdown next to send button: 🏷️ Link to Topics → shows checkboxes for existing topics. (3) System prompt will include instructions for AI to detect when to suggest topic creation. Will design this carefully. Mockup will show."
Topic Extraction - Timing,AI Logic,HIGH - core feature,Decided,When should AI suggest creating topics? (A) After every AI response (B) When user asks (C) After detecting pattern shift?,Hybrid: AI analyzes after response. If 2+ distinct subjects detected it shows suggestion banner at top of chat: Create 2 topics? [Subject 1] [Subject 2] [Dismiss]. User can edit titles before creating.,"Okay, good. You're thinking the same way as me. That's a good idea but it needs to keep doing it as it goes on. I used to be intelligent on topic needs to be expanded into two for example.","AGREED + ENHANCED: AI suggests topics after each response AND can suggest splitting existing topics when conversation diverges. E.g. 'I noticed [API Design] topic now covers 2 distinct things: REST endpoints + GraphQL schema. Split into 2 topics?' Smart ongoing analysis."
Topic Extraction - UI Pattern,AI Logic,HIGH,Decided,If AI suggests topics mid-conversation how do we show it without interrupting flow?,Inline suggestion bubble appears above chat input: I noticed we discussed 3 things: [API Design] [Database Choice] [Error Handling] → [Create Topics] [Not Now]. Non-blocking stays there until dismissed.,"Okay, very good. This funny because I'm predicting what you say next.","HA! We're in sync. 😄 This non-blocking pattern is key - doesn't interrupt but stays visible until user acts."
Topic Extraction - Auto vs Manual,AI Logic,HIGH,Decided,Should AI auto-create topics or always ask user first?,Always ask first for MVP. Auto-create comes later as a user preference. Users need to trust the system before it acts autonomously.,I agree,"DECIDED: Always ask first. Trust is critical."
Topic Linking - Which Message,AI Logic,HIGH,Decided,When linking a message to a topic how do we handle one message mentioning multiple topics?,Many-to-many relationship: One message can link to multiple topics. Store relevance score per link (0-100). When viewing a topic only show messages with relevance > 30%. UI: Topic chips appear above/below message.,Why do you say many to many? Isn't this part of what we discussed before project has multiple topics?What? What we have as a separate object is now the chat constantly on the side.,"CLARIFICATION: 'Many-to-many' is DB term meaning: one message can relate to multiple topics AND one topic can relate to multiple messages. Example: Your message 'We need good error handling and validation' relates to BOTH [Error Handling] topic AND [Validation] topic. This is normal - conversations naturally cross topic boundaries. Does that make sense?"
Topic Linking - Visual Indication,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,How should we visually show which messages relate to which topics in the chat?,When hovering over a topic in right panel highlight related messages in chat with colored left border (topic's color). When hovering message show small topic pills inline.,I don't understand maybe you would need to show me. All of The stuff we discuss here needs to be created in a mock before we implement. I think that's the way to go to look at when you are developing.,"AGREED 100% - Will show in mockup. Visual: when you hover a topic card on right, the related chat messages on left get a colored left border (using topic's color). Makes connection visible. Mockup coming!"
Topic Status Changes,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,Current mock has status dropdown in modal. Should we also have quick status change in topic list?,Yes - both places. Topic list: click status badge to open dropdown (open → in-progress → resolved → archived). Modal: dropdown like current design.,"Yes, but I don't understand the reason for the question because we're just putting the chat on the left rather than send to AI As we had it before. We're changing the UI to a certain extent, we're not changing the infrastructure","YOU'RE RIGHT - We're keeping all the existing topic functionality (status, modal, cards). Just changing the layout to add chat on left. No infrastructure change needed, just UI rearrangement."
Artifact Display - Location,Document Management,HIGH - needed for MVP,Decided,Where should we show documents/artifacts that AI creates? In chat or separate panel?,Show inline in chat as a special message type with preview card. Click to expand full screen overlay (like Claude artifacts). Preview shows: doc icon title snippet [View Full] button.,I think so. Do you know how ChatGPT and Gemini deal with these things? Could we think of a better way to do it but I don't want to reinvent the wheel just for the sake of it.,"ChatGPT/Gemini show inline with expand option. Claude's approach is cleanest: preview in chat, click to full screen. Let's use that pattern - proven UX. Your sectioned approach (which I saw in your app) is BETTER for editing than theirs. We can innovate on the editing side."
Artifact Display - Editing,Document Management,HIGH,Decided,How should user edit artifacts? Inline editing or separate editor?,Full screen editor overlay. Left = editable document (markdown or code editor) Right = outline/structure navigator. Save button or auto-save every 2sec.,"We need to be able to edit and add comments. I will share a screen of how I do it in my other app and if you want access to the code, you can have it. Although maybe this could be a little bit different.","PERFECT - I saw your app! Your approach is excellent: Sections tab shows all sections with quality scores, Comments panel on right, Regenerate per section. Let's use similar pattern: Click artifact → full screen with tabs: 📄 Sections | 📋 Document | 💬 Comments. Each section has Copy/Regenerate buttons. Comments anchored to sections. Will adapt your code."
Artifact Sections - JSON Structure,Document Management,HIGH,Decided,Steve mentioned splitting docs into sections in JSON. What's the structure?,Need Steve to share structure from other app. Propose: {type: document sections: [{id: s1 title: heading content: markdown order: 1}] version: 1}. AI only regenerates specific sections not whole doc.,"Trying to give you an example as well. I can't see an example right now, but it's really just having one on file and with a new header In the doc It creates a new section in the json file. And then we use a certain well known json Format for the contents So it contains bullets and numbers numbers, et cetera . I forget what it's called, but it's what journalist use the standard. And you can see the image attached that you can content, put commenting and regenerate just that section.","GOT IT - You're using ProseMirror JSON! It's the standard for rich text editors (what journalists use). Structure: {type:'doc', content:[{type:'paragraph', content:[{type:'text', text:'...'}]}]}. Your app splits on H1/H2 headers to create sections. Each section = {id, title, order, content:ProseMirrorJSON, metadata:{qualityScore, wordCount}}. Will use exact same structure."
Artifact Comments - UI,Document Management,HIGH - you mentioned this needed,Decided,How should commenting on artifacts work? Inline comments or sidebar?,Hybrid: Click any section → comment sidebar slides from right. Comments anchored to section ID. Shows: user avatar comment text timestamp. Reply threading.,"Yes, something like that. And when they exit, we need to give AI enough information exactly what to do.","SMART - When user saves comment, we'll capture: sectionId, paragraphId (if specific), commentText, context (surrounding text). This gives AI clear instructions for regeneration: 'Regenerate section X addressing comment: [user's comment]. Current content: [section text].' Clear prompts = better results."
Artifact Comments - Creating Topics,Document Management,MEDIUM,Decided,When user comments on artifact section should that auto-create a topic or ask?,Ask first. Show suggestion: This comment could be tracked as a topic: [Use JWT tokens] → [Create Topic] [Just Comment]. If Create Topic the comment becomes first response in topic.,Once they save their comment that it becomes a new topic. Before they don't waste it.,"UNDERSTOOD - Comment is always saved. After saving, show: 'Track this as a topic? [Yes] [No]'. If Yes → creates topic with comment as first response. If No → comment stays as comment only. User doesn't lose anything."
Analytics - What to Show,Analytics,MEDIUM,Decided,You said 1-2 simple analytics for MVP. What specifically?,Minimum: (1) Topic count by status (pie chart) (2) Recent activity timeline (last 7 days bar chart). Optional: (3) Topics by category (bar chart).,You decide what we have information for what looks good. It's justTo show that it works.,"DECISION: Will show (1) Status counts with colored badges (2) Timeline of topic creation (3) Simple category breakdown. Uses Chart.js for clean visuals. Just proof of concept - can expand later."
Analytics - Real-time vs Static,Analytics,LOW,Decided,Should analytics update in real-time as topics created or only on page load?,Update immediately when topic created/status changed. Use simple state management no polling needed since it's same client session.,"Assuming everything goes into our database as it's all local data, each time u open a screen, it should show the latest info but doesn't neeed to update in real time","AGREED - Load fresh data when analytics view opens. No live updates needed. Simpler and good enough."
Search - Scope,Features,MEDIUM,Decided,Current mock has global search. Should search cover: (A) Just topics (B) Topics + chat messages (C) Everything including artifacts?,Everything. Search box in top bar. Results grouped: Messages (with context) Topics (with status) Artifacts (with preview). Click result to jump to location.,(Steve didn't answer this one),"DEFAULT: Search everything (messages, topics, artifacts). Results grouped by type. Click to jump to location. Search is powerful when comprehensive."
Topic Categories - Predefined or Free,Data Model,LOW,Decided,Should categories be: (A) Predefined dropdown (technical design business) or (B) Free text tags or (C) Both?,Both. Predefined categories for consistency + free-form tags for flexibility. Categories are single-select tags are multi-select. AI suggests both when creating topic.,Yes and allow a setting/admin for customers to add their own. Or manage their own including removing predifined ones.,"EXCELLENT - Settings page: Manage Categories. Default: Technical, Design, Business, Content. Users can: Add custom, Remove/hide defaults, Reorder. Stored per-project in DB. AI uses project's category list when suggesting."
Topic Priority - Needed?,Data Model,LOW,Decided,Do we need priority field (high/medium/low) or is status enough?,Keep priority for MVP. Users think in terms of what's urgent. Shows as colored indicator: 🔴 high 🟡 medium ⚪ low. AI infers from language (ASAP urgent critical = high).,yes,"CONFIRMED - Priority stays. Simple visual indicators in UI."
Related Topics - Auto-linking,AI Logic,MEDIUM,Decided,Should AI auto-detect when topics are related and link them? Or manual only?,AI suggests relationships but user confirms. When creating new topic if AI detects similarity (>60% embedding match) show: Similar topics: [API Authentication] [JWT Implementation] → [Link as Related?].,I think the links are interesting but not critical,"AGREED - Nice-to-have, not critical. Will implement AI suggestion for similar topics but it's not MVP blocker. Can add after core features work."
Multi-Project - MVP?,Scope,MEDIUM - reduces scope,Decided,Current mock has project selector. Do we need multi-project in MVP or single project?,Single project for MVP. Removes complexity. Add project switching in Phase 2. Just have one default project per user.,"I will have multiple projects for sure because there will be multiple cases that we want to show. Anyway, we should build a database to support the whole idea including organisations and departments but for the MVP We will not be filling in those details","PERFECT PLAN - DB schema includes: organizations, departments, projects (full hierarchy). For MVP: create multiple projects but no org/dept UI. Just project dropdown. You can manually create test projects for demo cases. Full admin UI = Phase 2."
Export - Format,Features,LOW,Decided,What export formats needed? Markdown? PDF? JSON?,Markdown for MVP: Export conversation as .md file with topics as H2 sections. Export single topic as .md. JSON export for backup/migration (raw data). PDF nice-to-have for Phase 2.,Are you talking about exporting for a IT use? You tell me what's best. Or do you mean for the customer? For the customer we don't need to export anything right now. Any export I can send things to AI if I need to.,"CLARIFIED - I meant for YOU (development/debugging). JSON export = backup entire project data. Can send to AI for analysis. FOR CUSTOMERS: Not needed for MVP. We can add customer-facing exports later (PDF reports, etc.)."
Data Persistence,Technical,HIGH - prevents data loss,Decided,Should we save to Turso on every message or batch save?,Save every message immediately. Also save draft messages to localStorage so user doesn't lose text if browser crashes. Turso is fast enough for immediate writes.,Correct,"CONFIRMED - Immediate save + localStorage backup. Prevents data loss."
Undo Functionality,Technical,MEDIUM,Decided,How far back should undo go? Just last action or full history?,Store last 20 actions in memory: message sent topic created status changed topic deleted. Simple [Undo] link appears for 5 seconds after action. After 5 sec action is permanent.,You decide what's feasible and don't add too much complication,"SIMPLE APPROACH: Just [Undo] for topic deletion. Toast shows 'Topic deleted. [Undo]' for 5 seconds. Keeps deleted item in memory. Other actions don't need undo (messages can be deleted, status can be changed back). Minimal complexity."
Error Handling - AI API,Technical,HIGH,Decided,If Gemini API fails (rate limit network error) what's the UX?,Show error in chat: ⚠️ AI temporarily unavailable. Your message is saved. [Retry] [Use Offline Model]. Queue message to retry in 30sec. Fallback to Ollama if available.,Something like that,"AGREED - Graceful degradation. Message is saved, user can retry. If repeated failures, suggest checking API key/quota."
Offline Mode,Technical,LOW - not MVP,Decided,Should app work offline at all? Or require internet?,Require internet for MVP. Offline mode needs service workers + local model + sync logic = too complex. Show friendly message: 📡 You're offline. Reconnecting…,No Off-line mode,"CONFIRMED - Online only for MVP."
Loading States,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,How should we show AI is thinking? Typing indicator? Skeleton?,Typing indicator: Three animated dots below last message (like iMessage). Appears immediately when user hits send. Shows while waiting for API response.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Three dots animation. Clean and expected UX."
Empty States,UI/UX,MEDIUM,Decided,"When user first opens app (no messages no topics) what do they see?",Chat shows: Welcome message + 3 example prompts as clickable buttons: Help me design an API Review this architecture Draft a technical spec. Topics panel shows: No topics yet. They'll appear as you chat.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Friendly onboarding with example prompts. Gets users started quickly."
Message Editing,Features,LOW,Decided,Can user edit their sent messages? Or only delete/resend?,No editing sent messages for MVP (too complex with AI context). User can delete last message + AI response then resend. Simple [Delete] icon on message hover.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Delete + resend pattern. Simpler than edit."
Conversation History Limit,Technical,LOW,Decided,Should we limit how many messages display in chat? Infinite scroll or pagination?,Infinite scroll loading oldest messages as user scrolls up. Initially load last 50 messages. Virtual scrolling if performance issue (unlikely for MVP).,Okay. We also need to find how many old messages get sent in the API to AI when sending a message. I don't know how that has managed because Claude that's automatically.,"GOOD POINT - Will implement smart context window: (1) Always send system prompt (2) Send last 20 messages in full (3) Summarize older messages if conversation is long. This way AI has recent context without hitting token limits. Will write function to manage this."
AI Context Window,Technical,LOW - unlikely in MVP,Decided,How do we handle when conversation exceeds Gemini's context limit?,Gemini Flash 2.0 has 2M tokens (~1.5M words) so unlikely to hit in MVP. If we do: Summarize older messages keep last 20 full. Store full conversation in DB always just send summarized version to AI.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Summarization strategy if needed. Very unlikely for MVP given Gemini's huge context."
System Prompts,AI Logic,MEDIUM,Decided,What system prompt should we use for the AI assistant?,Need Steve's input on AI personality. Propose: You are a helpful AI assistant for project discussions. Analyze conversations to identify distinct topics decisions and action items. Be concise and ask clarifying questions.,"Yes, we just need a normal AI response for now. We need to add information for it so it knows how to give us information for our system. Could we even give them the chance to choose what personality they want AI to be so the beginning of a project of maybe in the middle it could be a general AI, a developer expert, content writer expert et cetera","BRILLIANT IDEA! Project settings: AI Personality dropdown: General Assistant, Developer Expert, Product Manager, Content Writer, Designer. Each has different system prompt. Can change mid-project. System prompt includes: (1) Personality (2) Instructions to detect topics (3) Response format guidelines. Will make prompt library."
Topic Title Generation,AI Logic,MEDIUM,Decided,How should AI generate topic titles? User can edit but what's the default?,Extract 3-6 word title capturing core subject. Format: Noun + descriptive phrase (API error handling strategy) not sentences (How should we handle API errors?). User can always edit.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Short descriptive titles, not questions. User can always edit."
Topic Description,AI Logic,LOW,Decided,Should topics have both title AND description? Or just title?,Both. Title is short (shown in list). Description is 1-2 sentences (shown in modal) providing context. AI generates both but user can edit.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Title + description. More context is better."
Shortcuts/Hotkeys,UX,LOW,Decided,Any keyboard shortcuts needed?,Essential ones: ⌘+K = focus search ⌘+Enter = send message Escape = close modal Tab = navigate ⌘+/ = show shortcuts. Power users love shortcuts.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Will implement basic shortcuts. Hidden power feature for speed."
Notification System,Features,LOW,Decided,Should app have notifications? (New topic created AI finished thinking),Toast notifications only for MVP. Small popup bottom-right: ✓ Topic created Successfully exported Error occurred. Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Simple toast notifications. Clean feedback."
Theme - Dark Mode,UI/UX,LOW - skip for MVP,Decided,Current mock is light mode. Do we need dark mode for MVP?,Skip dark mode for MVP. Add in Phase 2. Significantly increases CSS work. Most PM/tech tools used during day anyway.,"Okay, make it easy to change so it's not hard to add a different Theme","AGREED - Will use CSS custom properties (--color-primary, etc.) so theme swapping is easy later. Light mode only for MVP but architected for themes."
Responsive Breakpoints,Technical,MEDIUM,Decided,At what screen size should we switch to mobile layout?,Desktop: 1024px+ (chat left topics right). Tablet: 768-1023px (collapsible panels). Mobile: <768px (tabs at bottom). Test on: iPhone SE desktop 1920px.,Okay,"CONFIRMED - Standard breakpoints. Will test on key sizes."
Git Strategy,Process,LOW,Decided,Should we keep current demo or create new repo for real MVP?,Keep same repo. Create /mvp folder for new Next.js app. Keep /current for demo reference. Cleaner than new repo keeps history. Can delete demo later.,Okay. I think we will keep creating the HTML demo because it's a great way for me to understand the spec to check if things work in the real app so I can compare.,"PERFECT - /demo folder = HTML mockups (visual spec). /mvp folder = real Next.js app. /Planning folder = docs. Keep demos as reference. Great for alignment!"
Development Approach,Process,HIGH - need agreement on order,Decided,Build features in what order?,Week 1: Chat UI + Gemini integration + Turso schema. Week 2: Topic creation + linking. Week 3: Topic list + detail view + status. Week 4: Artifact display + commenting. Week 5: Analytics + polish.,You decide as the developer. What you call weeks is really an hour or two for you so it doesn't matter so much,"HA! True, I work fast. REVISED ORDER: Day 1: Schema + chat + Gemini. Day 2: Topic extraction. Day 3: Topics list + detail. Day 4: Artifacts. Day 5: Analytics + polish. Will go feature-by-feature, test as we build."
Testing Strategy,Process,LOW,Decided,Manual testing or automated tests for MVP?,Manual testing for MVP. You test + I fix. Add tests in Phase 2. Jest + React Testing Library for Next.js when we scale.,"Yes, but you need to do some thorough QA testing for lint and everything else. I want you to to build a way that you can actually run full tests of the system yourself even if it didn't mean you making extra bits of code to mimic what we do in the UI because you can certainly call the AI model and get results. Think about that.","SMART APPROACH - Will create test scripts that: (1) Call Gemini API directly with test messages (2) Create topics programmatically (3) Test DB operations (4) Verify JSON structure. Can run full flow without UI. Like integration tests. Good for regression checking."
Deployment,Process,LOW,Decided,Where to deploy MVP? Vercel?,Vercel for frontend (free auto-deploy from GitHub). Turso for DB (free tier). Domain: exelentthreads.vercel.app or custom domain if you have one?,It will be on vercel But I will be running it for the time being just for my machine,"UNDERSTOOD - Local development first. When ready to deploy, it's just 'vercel deploy'. No rush. Focus on building first."
Environment Variables,Technical,HIGH,Decided,What API keys/secrets needed?,GEMINI_API_KEY = Gemini API key. TURSO_DATABASE_URL = Turso connection. TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN = Turso auth. Store in .env.local not committed. You'll need to create both.,I know. I did go to the previous app and I'll do it for this one.,"CONFIRMED - You've got this. Will create .env.example with instructions."
AI Router Reference,Steve's other app,,,,,Is located here. /Users/stevewiseman/Documents/Github/exelentairelease. Maybe look at the AI router as well as the generation pages for how we created the json and UI for generated content,"EXPLORED - Saw your AI task router, ProseMirror sections, comments system. Excellent patterns. Will adapt for ExelentThreads. Your code quality is great - clean separation of concerns."
Topic Grouping Strategy,New Idea,HIGH,Open,,,,"NEW INSIGHT FROM STEVE: User could tell AI to group conversation into N topics (e.g. 'Organize into 10 topics') OR let AI decide naturally. This could be: (A) Project-level setting: 'Target 10-15 topics per project' or (B) Message-level command: User types 'Organize our discussion into 5 main topics'. Both useful! Thoughts?"
